# Fraud-Detection-Program
A machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent financial transactions using a real-world dataset with over 6.3 million records. Includes EDA, feature engineering, and model training.

# Overview

This project aims to develop a robust and scalable fraud detection pipeline using machine learning techniques. The pipeline was built on a large Kaggle dataset consisting of over 6.3 million financial transactions.

The objective is to predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent based on features like transaction type, amount, balances, and more. This project covers the full data science lifecycle: from data wrangling to model deployment-ready output.

# üìÇ Dataset

Source: Kaggle (labeled as "AIML Dataset")

Size: 6,362,620 records

Key Features:

type: Type of transaction (e.g., TRANSFER, CASH_OUT)

amount: Transaction amount

oldbalanceOrg & newbalanceOrig: Sender's balances before and after transaction

oldbalanceDest & newbalanceDest: Receiver's balances before and after transaction

isFraud: Label (1 for fraud, 0 for normal)

# üîÅ Project Workflow

Data Import & Cleaning

Loaded dataset using Pandas

Removed irrelevant columns

Handled missing and zero-balance edge cases

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distribution of transaction types and fraud occurrence

Identified correlation among features

Visualized balance changes and suspicious patterns

Feature Engineering

Created new features like balance_diff, is_same_sender_receiver, etc.

Normalized amount-based features

Modeling & Evaluation

Trained classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

Evaluated on metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Saved the best model as fraud_detection_pipeline.pkl

# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis

Fraudulent transactions are concentrated in TRANSFER and CASH_OUT types

Imbalance between fraud and non-fraud classes (required special care during modeling)

High-value transactions are disproportionately likely to be fraudulent

# üß† Feature Engineering & Selection

Removed nameOrig, nameDest due to lack of predictive power

Engineered:

errorBalanceOrig = oldbalanceOrg - newbalanceOrig - amount

errorBalanceDest = newbalanceDest - oldbalanceDest - amount

Used SelectKBest and correlation filtering for final feature set

# ü§ñ Modeling Approach

Algorithms tried:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier (final pick)

Why Random Forest:

Better handles class imbalance

High recall without overfitting

Handling Imbalance:

Used stratified sampling and adjusted class weights

# üìà Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy: Overall correctness

Precision: Fraction of predicted frauds that were actual frauds

Recall: Fraction of real frauds that were detected

F1 Score: Balance between Precision and Recall

ROC-AUC: Performance across thresholds
